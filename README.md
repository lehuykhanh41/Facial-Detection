![Main Photo](https://github.com/lehuykhanh41/Facial_Detection/blob/master/Pics/detection1.jpg)

## 1. OVERVIEW AND FEATURES:

This small project implements OpenCV's Haar Cascade facial detection model, which helps to identify faces in pictures, as well as in live webcam.

Features:
- Photo Detection: Detect faces in static photos.
- Webcam Detection: Detect faces live in cameras.

## 2. INSTALLS:

You will need OpenCV's package and Matplotlib:
